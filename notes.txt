I'm starting this so I don't have to solve the same problems twice as much as possible.

The advice for fixing my install issue was found here: https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/7814
The issue will be fixed when either one of nodejs/node#55602 or npm/npm-install-checks#120 lands
In the meantime you can use --force --libc=glibc or downgrade to npm 10.3.0 to avoid this issue

npm install -g npm@10.3.0
npx create-next-app@latest
TypeScript
use ESLint
dont use Tailwind
Use App Router
don't use turbopack
not custom import alias

push to github with
gh repo create

# Installing the database stuff:
npm install @prisma/client
npm install prisma --save-dev
npm install sqlite3
npx prisma init
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate

To deploy:
Made an account with vercel
I made an account on suprabase. Made my scores table schema. 
Got the environment variables from https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs

Make sure to run with `npm run dev` for changes to take effect
