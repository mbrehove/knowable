Recommendations from Joseph:

2. Show the rule next to/under the advice in the side pannel during Phase 1.5 and 2
3. Have early unknown level phases at 4 and 7 so they can ease into phase II
4. Make a "replay" button to play the level again so people can better understand it.
5. Green arrows in the levelComplete screen indicating which were optimal
6. Siloets of the advice authors off to the right. 
7: add music
8: add Phase color transitions
9: Port to mobile
